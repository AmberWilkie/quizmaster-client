# eQuizmaster - a mobile client

First and foremost, a great many thanks to @b264 for his and his colleagues' work on [ngActionCable](https://github.com/angular-actioncable/angular-actioncable), without which this project would be impossible.

### Platforms & Technologies
 - Ionic
 - ngActionCable
 
### Server
  The back end and web application code for this mobile client is here: [Quizmaster](https://github.com/CraftAcademy/quizmaster).
  
### Viewing the programs in action
  - Head to [equizmaster.com](https://www.equizmaster.com), register as a Quizmaster and create a quiz, or just go to [the first quiz](https://www.equizmaster.com/quizmaster/quiz/1). If you see any "Correct" buttons, reset the quiz.
  - Using either Ionic View (code c3d43010) or downloading the app from the [Android store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionicframework.quizmasterclient398345), and put in the code from the Quizmaster page.
  - Name your team. Now you're ready to play the game.
  - We hope the rest of the mechanics are self-explanatory. If anything is puzzling, please let us know! (And keep in mind that this is an early prototype, and a student project at that. Not everything works perfectly.)
